		Food poisoning is an illness caused by eating contaminated food. Usually this illness goes away without treatment but it is a nasty thing to experience. Usually the food that causes food poisoning is contaminated by bacteria. For example: salmonella or Escherichia coli. Sometimes it is contaminated by a virus, such as the norovirus.
	The symptoms from food poisoning usually kick in 1-3 days after eating the contaminated food. For example:
	<li> Feeling sick </li>
	<li> Vomiting </li>
	<li> Diarrhoea </li>
	<li> Stomach cramps. </li>

	Here are some foods that are most likely to become contaminated if not handled, stored or cooked properly:
	<li> raw meat and poultry </li>
	<li> raw eggs </li>
	<li> raw shellfish </li>
	<li> unpasteurised milk </li>
	<li> Ready to eat foods, such as cooked sliced meats, p&acirct&eacute, soft cheeses and pre-packed sandwiches. </li>
	We have put this brief but useful information on our website in order to help you avoid this in future when eating in a restaurant which you have no experience with, or maybe even in your own kitchen when cooking foods like the above.
